# Project BookRecep

### Main idea:
An application for book lovers to share and recap their favorite books to communities. This help spread main ideas in books to busy people who don't have time to read through the entire book

### Personal developmennt
I had this idea when I was reading a 400-page book and tired going thorough the entire book just to retain 20% of it. What if there's a community of people who read the book and recap the main ideas in just a few paragraphs. I can just read those recaps and done with the book. That could save a huge amount of my time. 

I built this app to learn React primarily. Backend  uses Firebase to simplify many configurations and setups so that I can focus on the app logic.
